# CovolutionalNeuralNetworks
# Image Classification on the training and test datasets.
# Datapreprocessing on the training set which involves feature scaling and the transformations applied are shear range,zoom range and horizontal flip.
# Feature scaling is also done on the test set as well.
# Building the CNN, Pooling, Flattening are implemented with fully connected layers and the rectifier activation function is used in the hidden layers.
# In between the filters, kernal size, pool size and the strides are chosen along with the input shape.
# Training the model on the train set and make predictions on the test set.
